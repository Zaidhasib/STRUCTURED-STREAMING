* Structured streaming is the scalable and fault tolerant stream processing engine built on top of apache spark sql engine.
The spark SQL engine will take care of running it incrementally and continuosly and updating the final results as streaming data continues 
to  arrive.

* Structured streaming provides fast, scalable,fault-tolerant , end to end exactly one stream processing without the user having about 
streaming.

* Internally by default, Structured streaming queries are procesed uisng micro-batch processing engine, which process the data
in small batches . 

* Since spark 2.3 , a new low latency processing mode called Continuos processing , which can achieved end-to-end latency as  1 ms with
alteast once gruanteed.
